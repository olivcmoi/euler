#By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

#1 + 1/(2 + 1/2) = 7/5 = 1.4

#The next three expansions are 99/70, 239/169, and 577/408, but the eighth expansion, 1393/985, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.
#In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than denominator?
