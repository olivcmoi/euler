#Large non-Mersenne prime
#Problem 97
#The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a Mersenne prime of the form pow(2,6972593)âˆ’1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently other Mersenne primes, of the form 2pâˆ’1, have been found which contain more digits.

#However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits: 28433Ã—pow(2,7830457)+1.

#Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
